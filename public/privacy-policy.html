          out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
          access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on

      <h1>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific
        situations described in this section and/or with the following
        categories of third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service
          Providers.</strong

        We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers,
        contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or
        on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The categories of third parties we may share personal information with
        are as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Communication & Collaboration Tools</li>
        <li>Data Analytics Services</li>
        <li>Payment Processors</li>
        <li>Performance Monitoring Tools</li>

        <li>Website Hosting Service Providers</li>
        <li>Testing Tools</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We also may need to share your personal information in the following
        situations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your
          information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger,
          sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion
          of our business to another company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We may share
          your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google
          Maps API, Places API). We use certain Google Maps Platform APIs to
          retrieve certain information when you make location-specific requests.
          This includes: Location; and other similar information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A full list of what we use information for can be found in this section
        and in the previous section titled "<strong
          >HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong
        >" Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your
        location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell
        towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors.
        This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always
        perfectly precise.

        We obtain and store on your device ("cache") your location. You may
        revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details

        we use store and access cookies and other information on your devices.

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking
        technologies to collect and store your information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
        and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.
        Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our
        Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
        preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also permit third parties and service providers to use online
        tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising,
        including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor
        advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart
        reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third
        parties and service providers use their technology to provide
        advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which
        may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a
        "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under
        the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of
        these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described
        below under section "<strong

      <h1>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as
        necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless
        otherwise required by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h1>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information
        through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.

      <h1>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or
        market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as
        specified by law in your jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children
        under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your
        jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By
        using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the
        equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are
        the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
        dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information
        from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified
        by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the
        account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from
        our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
        children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your
        jurisdiction, please contact us at

      <h1>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the
        US or in some regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you
        greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
        review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
        country, province, or state of residence.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable
        data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access
        and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
        rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
        personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v)
        not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that
        produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by
        automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer
        a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may
        also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
        information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the
        contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT
        THIS NOTICE?" below.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
        data protection laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u></strong> If we are relying on
        your consent to process your personal information, which may be express
        and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
        right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
        consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
        provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"
        below.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU
        CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the

        example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the
        administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests,
        or for other non-marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        No mobile information will be shared with third parties or affiliates
        for marketing or promotional purposes. Information sharing to

      <h1>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h1>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

        Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request
        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
        validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable
        laws.
      </p>

      <h1>Request Verification</h1>

      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
      </p>

        Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take

        for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint
        to your state attorney general.
